Hi, I am an educational researcher emphasizing on the filed of learning from errors. I got my Ph.D. at Zhejiang University and am working at [new affiliation].

My research interests fall in educational psychology and its connection with teaching and learning practices, including the topics of learning from errors, self-regulated learning, and teacher judgments.

I would like to cooperate with researchers and teachers worldwide to design and conduct fun research on teaching and learning improvement.
