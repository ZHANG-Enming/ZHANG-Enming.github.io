Hi, I am an assistant professor of learning and instruction at the Institute of Educational Sciences, Hunan University. My research interests lie in educational psychology and its applications to improve teaching and learning, with a particular focus on learning from errors. Two questions intrigue me and guide my work: (1) How can students stay positive when commiting errors and facing failure? (2) How can they adopt appropriate/effective strategies to learn from their errors? From the perspective of learning sciences, my current research analyzes students' error reflections to deepen our understanding of how they learn from their errors. I collaborate with school teachers and fellow researchers on empirical and practical studies to develop and validate strategies that enhance the quality of processes of learning from errors. Through strategy instruction and training, I aim to help students strengthen their ability to learn from errors, ultimately expanding their lifelong toolbox for addressing errors, setbacks, and uncertainty.
