Hi, I am an educational researcher specializing in the field of learning from errors, currently working at [new affiliation]. My interest in educational research was sparked during my undergraduate years, fueled by teaching experiences at cram schools during summer and winter vacations. This led me to pursue a six-year master-to-doctoral program at the College of Education, Zhejiang University, where I majored in curriculum and teaching methodology. My international experiences, which include visits to India for one week, Germany for one month, and Japan for one year, enriched my understanding of global educational practices and enabled me to approach educational issues from diverse perspectives.

My research interests fall in educational psychology and its application to improve teaching and learning practices, with a particular focus on learning from errors. I do not limit myself to specific research methodologies; instead, I strive to employ whichever quantitative or qualitative methods best address the questions that intrigue me.

I am open and eager to collaborate with researchers and teachers from around the world to design and conduct fun research that enhances teaching and learning.
